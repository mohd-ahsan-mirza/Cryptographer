# Cryptographer

I have imported my ConsoleAppForTranslator application (also available on my GitHub page) as a DLL file to a windows forms application and developed a program which will 
allowed users to encrypt and decrypt text in real time. There is also input validation and an unique way to communicate resulting errors 
to the user through the UI (Just hover over the red highlighted labels and you will see the details of the errors).
